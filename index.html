It is no wonder then, that a large and welcoming community formed around tailoring Linux to become a perfect fit for your work flow and aesthetic preferences. This community, dubbed "ricers" after the similar hobby of customizing cars, has created pieces of software that truly allow anyone of any skill level with Linux to shape their experience to their tastes.</div></div><div class=section><div class=article-subtitle>> Preperations</div><div class=intro-paragraph>Ricing can be extremely annoying, difficult, and devoid of many benefits if you don't make the right preperations before hand. While you can technically make any rice you want from any starting point, certain starting points will be much easier to theme to your liking than others.<ul class=ul-group><li>Make sure to use either a minimal distro, or a distro that's designed around the window manager or desktop environment you plan on ricing. I find EndeavorOS or vanilla Arch to be the best distros for ricing.</li><br><li>Get your system usable before customizing it. Installing a web browser and a terminal emulator right from the start will make the rest of your ricing much easier.</li><br><li>Get comfortable navigating your system from the TTY, since you're going to break your desktop rather frequently, especially at the beginning.</li><br><li>Having a USB that's flashed with a batteries included distro is a good safety net if you messed up your system past a reasonable recovery.</ul></div></div><div class=section><div class=article-subtitle>> Parts</div><div class=intro-paragraph>One of the key reasons Linux is so customizeable is because of its modularity. It is thanks to this modularity, that you're able to pick and choose every single aspect of your desktop experience. Here is a list of potential "parts" that I found to be useful in general Linux setups, but you are by no means required to have all or even any of them in your own rice:<ul><li><div class=window-list-element>Display Servers</div>The display protocol is responsible for communication between various parts of your system in order to draw applications to your screen. Without one, you could only use the command line. For the longest time, this decision was made for you, as there used to be only one main option… Now, there are two, and for good reason!<ul class=ul-group><li><u>X11</u> The X11 display protocol has been around since the mid-late 80s. With its age, it carries a key benefit all ancient softwares implicitly have. The vast majority of applications, even now, are primarily designed with X11 support in mind. Unfortunately, this is where the advantages end.<br><br>“X[11] works extremely well for what it is, but what it is is deeply flawed” - Adam Jackson, X.Org Project Owner<br><br>X11 is old, and fundamentally broken in more ways than one. There are many common issues that users encounter that can be attributed to the protocol, ranging screen tearing to unintuitive clipboard behavior when copy pasting between applications. The current recommendation is to use it only if you aren't able to use the modern alternative, Wayland.</li><br><li><u>Wayland</u> Wayland is the hip new kid on the display server block, and is an objective improvement over X11 in almost every single way. Its system wide, triple-buffer v-sync implementation completely eliminates screen tearing across all computers capable of running it, and its minimal overhead dramatically improves application startup to draw times.<br><br>However, trying to replace what has been the standard for nearly 40 years isn't easy. Wayland has issues when running under NVidia GPUs, ranging from it not working at all to artifacting when running specific apps. It is generally recommended that people running NVidia graphics cards stick to X11. Applications that are only native to X11 run under a translation layer dubbed XWayland. This translation layer is generally very good and applications running under it should enjoy near native performance, but it does introduce increased startup times.</li><br></ul>The rest of this guide will include separate options for both X11 and Wayland protocols.</li><br><li><div class=window-list-element>Display Managers</div>The Display Manager is what you see when you first boot into the system, it can be thought of as the login screen. It also handles certain background tasks relevant to your user session such as user authentification. Some popular display managers include:<ul class=ul-group><li>Ly(<a href=https://github.com/fairyglade/ly>GitHub</a>)<li>GDM(<a href=https://github.com/GNOME/gdm>GitHub</a>)<li>LightDM(<a href=https://github.com/CanonicalLtd/lightdm/ >GitHub</a>)<li>LXDM(<a href=https://github.com/GalliumOS/lxdm>GitHub</a>)<li>SSDM(<a href=https://github.com/sddm/sddm>GitHub</a>)</ul></li><br><li><div class=window-list-element>Window Managers/Desktop Environments</div>One of the key parts of any custom desktop is... The desktop itself of course! When it comes to applications that manage your desktop, you have two options:<ul class=ul-group><li><b>Window Managers</b>, which are light-weight and minimal pieces of software that simply manage where and how an application window will render and little to nothing else. Window managers can be split into two main groups with some supporing both approaches. Floating, and Tiling:<ul class=ul-group><li><b>Tiling Window Managers</b> automatically re-position all the windows on your screen whenever a new window appears. Some people find this more productive than manually placing windows themselves, while others dislike the lack of control. Examples of popular tiling window managers are:<ul class=ul-group><li><u>Wayland</u><ul class=ul-group><li>Sway(<a href=https://github.com/swaywm/sway>GitHub</a>)<li>Hyprland(<a href=https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland>GitHub</a>)<li>River(<a href=https://github.com/riverwm/river>GitHub</a>)<li>Qtile(<a href=http://www.qtile.org/ >Main Page</a>)</ul></li>More wayland window managers can be found <a href=https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/wayland><u>here</u></a><li><u>X11</u><ul class=ul-group><li>i3(<a href=https://github.com/i3/i3>GitHub</a>)<li>Awesome(<a href=https://awesomewm.org/ >Main Page</a>)<li>dwm(<a href=https://dwm.suckless.org/ >Main Page</a>)<li>BSPWM(<a href=https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm>GitHub</a>)<li>Qtile(<a href=http://www.qtile.org/ >Main Page</a>)<li>XMonad(<a href=https://github.com/xmonad/xmonad>GitHub</a>)</ul></ul></li><br><li><b>Floating Window Managers</b> are similar to the more conventional desktop experience you'd expect out of any modern operating system. When you start an application, it's up to you to position it or toggle maximize/fullscreen for the specific window. Examples of popular floating window managers are:<ul class=ul-group><li><u>Wayland</u></li><ul class=ul-group><li>Wayfire(<a href=https://github.com/WayfireWM/wayfire>GitHub</a>)<li>Labwc(<a href=https://github.com/labwc/labwc>GitHub</a>)</ul><li><u>X11</u></li><ul class=ul-group><li>Openbox(<a href=https://github.com/danakj/openbox>GitHub</a>)<li>Awesome(<a href=https://awesomewm.org/ >Main Page</a>)<li>2bwm(<a href=https://github.com/venam/2bwm>GitHub</a>)</ul></ul></ul><br><li><b>Desktop Environments</b>, which aim to be complete desktop experiences. They often times come with a window manager built in along with other pieces of software like a taskbars, screenshot tools, terminals, etc. Some examples of Desktop Environments include:</li><ul class=ul-group><li><u>Wayland</u></li><ul class=ul-group><li>GNOME<li>KDE</ul><li><u>X11</u></li><ul class=ul-group><li>GNOME<li>KDE<li>XFCE<li>LXQT<li>Budgie<li>Mate</ul></ul></ul></li><br><li><div class=window-list-element>Status Bars</div>Status Bars are applications used to represent certain information regarding your system. The information that they represent can be customized to only showcase relevant info that you care about.<ul class=ul-group><li>Wayland<ul class=ul-group><li>Waybar<li>Yambar</ul></li><br><li>X11<ul class=ul-group><li>Polybar<li>Lemonbar<li>i3bar<li>Tint2</ul></ul></li><br><li><div class=window-list-element>Application Launchers</div>Application Launchers allow the user to quickly search for and launch a specific application. They can also be "hacked" to support other usecases, i.e. window switching or clipboard management.<ul class=ul-group><li>Wayland<ul class=ul-group><li>Rofi<li>Dmenu</ul></li><br><li>X11<ul class=ul-group><li>Rofi Ibonn<li>Wofi<li>Bemenu</ul></ul></li><br><li><div class=window-list-element>Terminal Emulators</div>Terminal Emulators are a core part of any Linux desktop. They are primarily used to run shell commands, however many terminal emulators also support additional features like image viewing or tiling.<ul class=ul-group><li>Wayland<ul class=ul-group><li>Alacritty<li>GNOME terminal<li>Kitty<li>Tillix</ul></li><br><li>X11<ul class=ul-group><li>Foot<li>Alacritty<li>GNOME terminal<li>Kitty</ul></ul></li><br><li><div class=window-list-element>File Browsers</div>File Browsers in Linux are diverse and include extremely useful features. Options range from Thunar, which is a very customizeable and powerful GUI file broswer, to Ranger, which runs inside the command line.<ul class=ul-group><li>Thunar<li>Nautilus<li>Nemo<li>Ranger</ul></li><br><li><div class=window-list-element>Web Browsers</div>You should be using Firefox, as it's currently the only major browser that maintains support for UBlock Origin, the best adblocker around.</li><br><li><div class=window-list-element>Screenshot Tools</div>Screenshot Tools in Linux range from extremely minimal scripts to full blown GUIs. It's important to note that screenshots to the clipboard on X11 can be... Slow... An issue I often run into is I take a screenshot that I wish to paste in another application, and it fails paste as the screenshot hasn't fully copied over yet.<ul class=ul-group><li>Wayland<ul class=ul-group><li>Grim<li>Flameshot<li>GNOME Screenshot</ul></li><br><li>X11<ul class=ul-group><li>Shotgun<li>XSnip<li>Flameshot<li>GNOME Screenshot</ul></ul></li><br><li><div class=window-list-element>Image Viewers</div>Image Viewers vary in ease of use depending on the situation you're in. I recommend having multiple to cover various scenarios such as wanting to open an image from the terminal versus wanting to open an image from the file browser<ul class=ul-group><li>Wayland<ul class=ul-group><li>imv<li>pqiv<li>qimgv</ul></li><br><li>X11<ul class=ul-group><li>pqiv<li>qimgv<li>sxiv<li>feh</ul></ul></li><br><li><div class=window-list-element>Wallpaper Managers</div>Wallpaper Managers are usually very simple and straight forward. I usually recommend sticking with whatever tool your Desktop Environment or Window Manager came with, but in situations where your environment didn't come with one, Nitrogen and feh are good options.<ul class=ul-group><li>Wayland<ul class=ul-group><li>swaybg</ul></li><br><li>X11<ul class=ul-group><li>nitrogen<li>feh</ul></ul></li><br><li><div class=window-list-element>Brightness Adjusters</div>Brightness Adjusters that use a GUI can be quite the hastle for what is otherwise a very simple feature. I recommend CLI tools such as brightnessctl or light as you can create scripts or bind brightness controls to key bindings with them.<ul class=ul-group><li>brightnessctl<li>light</ul></li><br><li><div class=window-list-element>Audio Players</div><ul class=ul-group><li>Wayland<ul class=ul-group><li>GNOME Music<li>cmus<li>Lollypop<li>Elisa</ul></li><br><li>X11<ul class=ul-group><li>GNOME Music<li>cmus<li>Lollypop</ul></ul></li><br><li><div class=window-list-element>Video Players</div>Video Players are a topic of pretty heated discussion. The two main options people usually recommend are VLC and MPV, however I personally find GNOME Videos to also be a solid choice, especially since it will follow your GTK theme.<ul class=ul-group><li>Wayland<ul class=ul-group><li>VLC<li>MPV<li>GNOME Videos</ul></li><br><li>X11<ul class=ul-group><li>VLC<li>MPV<li>GNOME Videos</ul></ul></li><br><li><div class=window-list-element>Image Editors</div>Image Editors are one of the software groups that I find extremely lacking in Linux. The two main choices are Krita and GIMP, though I personally find Krita to have a nicer (albeit still extremely frustrating) UI and feature set.<ul class=ul-group><ul class=ul-group><li>Krita<li>GIMP</ul></ul></ul></div></div><div class=section><div class=article-subtitle>> Conclusion</div><div class=intro-paragraph>Ricing is not only a way to tailor your desktop around your prefered workflow, it's also a way for Linux enthusiasts to express themselves. It's a way to showcase your tastes, increase your knowledge of the Linux ecosystem, and for many, it's a way to make lifelong friends. The ricing community is one of the friendliest groups you'll ever find, and strives to make the hobby as inclusive and welcoming as possible.
