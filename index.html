It's no wonder then, that a large and welcoming community formed around tailoring Linux to become a perfect fit for your workflow and aesthetic preferences. This community, dubbed "ricers" after the similar hobby of customizing cars, has created pieces of software that truly allow anyone of any skill level with Linux to shape their experience to match their tastes. This article aims to be an overview of the modern software options novices should consider when creating their own setup.</div></div><div class=section><div class=article-subtitle>> Preperations</div><div class=intro-paragraph>Ricing can be annoying, difficult, and devoid of many benefits without the proper preperations. While you can technically make any rice you want from any starting point, certain starting points will be much easier to theme than others. Before we get started, here are some general words of advice:<ul class=ul-group><li>Use either a minimal distro, or a distro that's designed around the window manager/desktop environment you plan on ricing. Barebones distros like EndeavorOS will grant you greater flexibility in customizing your desktop than "batteries included" options like Ubuntu, while an distro like Fedora is known for offering a highly polished GNOME environment out of the box.</li><br><li>Get your system usable before customizing it. Installing a web browser and a terminal emulator at the beginning will make the rest of your ricing much easier.</li><br><li>Get comfortable navigating your system from the TTY, as it's a reliable tool for fixing broken setups. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1bz1DTD8Io">DistroTube's tutorial</a> serves as a good introduction to the basics of navigating the TTY.</li><br><li>Have a USB with a batteries included, live ISO on hand for situations where your rice is broken beyond reasonable repair.</ul></div></div><div class=section><div class=article-subtitle>> Parts</div><div class=intro-paragraph>Linux's modularity is a key reason as to why it's so customizable. It is thanks to this modularity, that you're able to pick and choose every single aspect of your desktop experience. Here is a list of potential "parts" that are often seen in conventional Linux setups, but you are by no means required to have all, or even any of them in your own rice:<ul><li><div class=window-list-element>Display Servers</div>The display protocol is responsible for handling communication between various parts of your system in order to draw applications to the screen. Without one, you could only use the command line. For the longest time, this decision was made for you, as there used to be only one industry standard. In fact, if this guide were made 5-10 years ago, this section wouldn't even exist!<ul class=ul-group><li><u>X11</u><br>The X11 display protocol has been around since the mid-late 80s. With its age, it carries a key benefit all ancient softwares implicitly have. The vast majority of applications, even now, are primarily designed with X11 support in mind. Unfortunately, this is where the advantages end.<br><br>“X[11] works extremely well for what it is, but what it is is deeply flawed” - Adam Jackson, X.Org Project Owner<br><br>X11 is old, and fundamentally broken in more ways than one. Going into its many issues and the reasons it fell out of the limelight in recent times is out of the scope of this guide. For a more detailed dive into X11's failings, <a href=https://www.phoronix.com/review/x_wayland_situation>this article</a> by blogger Eric Griffith, and ex-board member of the xorg foundation, Daniel Stone, paints a full picture regarding why the software garnered such a reputation. The current recommendation is to use it only if you aren't able to use the modern alternative, Wayland.<br><br><li><u>Wayland</u><br>Wayland is the hip new kid on the display server block, and is an objective improvement over X11 in almost every single way. Its system wide, triple-buffer v-sync implementation completely eliminates screen tearing across all computers capable of running it, and its minimal overhead dramatically improves application startup to draw times.<br><br>However, trying to replace what has been the standard for nearly 40 years isn't easy. Wayland has issues when running under NVidia GPUs, ranging from it not working at all to artifacting when running specific apps. <b>It is generally recommended that people running NVidia graphics cards stick to X11</b>. Applications that are only native to X11 run under a translation layer dubbed XWayland. This translation layer is generally very good and applications running under it should enjoy near native performance, but it does introduce increased startup times.</li><br></ul>The rest of this guide will include separate options for both X11 and Wayland protocols.</li><br><li><div class=window-list-element>Display Managers</div>The Display Manager is what you see when you first boot into the system, it can be thought of as the login screen. It also handles certain background tasks relevant to your user session, such as user authentification. Some popular display managers include:<ul class=ul-group><li>Ly(<a href=https://github.com/fairyglade/ly>GitHub</a>)<li>GDM(<a href=https://github.com/GNOME/gdm>GitHub</a>)<li>LightDM(<a href=https://github.com/CanonicalLtd/lightdm>GitHub)<li>LXDM(<a href=https://github.com/GalliumOS/lxdm>GitHub</a>)<li>SSDM(<a href=https://github.com/sddm/sddm>GitHub</a>)</ul></li><br><li><div class=window-list-element>Window Managers/Desktop Environments</div>One of the key parts of any custom desktop is... The desktop itself of course! When it comes to applications that manage your desktop, you have two options:<ul class=ul-group><li><b class=sub-title>Window Managers</b>, which are light-weight and minimal pieces of software that simply manage where and how an application window will render and little else. Window managers can be split into two main groups with some supporing both approaches. Floating, and Tiling:<ul class=ul-group><li><b class=sub-title>Tiling Window Managers</b> automatically re-position all the windows on your screen whenever a new window appears. Some people find this more productive than manually positioning windows themselves, while others dislike the lack of control. Examples of popular tiling window managers are:<ul class=ul-group><li><u>Wayland</u><ul class=ul-group><li>Sway(<a href=https://github.com/swaywm/sway>GitHub</a>)<li>Hyprland(<a href=https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland>GitHub</a>)<li>River(<a href=https://github.com/riverwm/river>GitHub</a>)<li>Qtile(<a href=http://www.qtile.org>Main Page)</ul></li>More wayland window managers can be found <a href=https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/wayland><u>here</u></a><li><u>X11</u><ul class=ul-group><li>i3(<a href=https://github.com/i3/i3>GitHub</a>)<li>Awesome(<a href=https://awesomewm.org>Main Page)<li>dwm(<a href=https://dwm.suckless.org>Main Page)<li>BSPWM(<a href=https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm>GitHub</a>)<li>Qtile(<a href=http://www.qtile.org>Main Page)<li>XMonad(<a href=https://github.com/xmonad/xmonad>GitHub</a>)</ul></ul></li><br><li><b class=sub-title>Floating Window Managers</b> are similar to the more conventional desktop experience you'd expect out of any modern operating system. When you start an application, it's up to you to position it or toggle maximize/fullscreen for the specific window. Examples of popular floating window managers are:<ul class=ul-group><li><u>Wayland</u></li><ul class=ul-group><li>Wayfire(<a href=https://github.com/WayfireWM/wayfire>GitHub</a>)<li>Labwc(<a href=https://github.com/labwc/labwc>GitHub</a>)</ul><li><u>X11</u></li><ul class=ul-group><li>Openbox(<a href=https://github.com/danakj/openbox>GitHub</a>)<li>Awesome(<a href=https://awesomewm.org>Main Page)<li>2bwm(<a href=https://github.com/venam/2bwm>GitHub</a>)</ul></ul></ul><br><li><b class=sub-title>Desktop Environments</b>, which aim to be complete desktop experiences. They often times come with a window manager built in along with other pieces of software like a taskbars, screenshot tools, terminals, etc. Some examples of Desktop Environments include:</li><ul class=ul-group><li><u>Wayland</u></li><ul class=ul-group><li>GNOME(<a href=https://www.gnome.org/ >Main Page</a>)<li>KDE(<a href=https://kde.org/ >Main Page</a>)</ul><li><u>X11</u></li><ul class=ul-group><li>GNOME(<a href=https://www.gnome.org/ >Main Page</a>)<li>KDE(<a href=https://kde.org/ >Main Page</a>)<li>XFCE(<a href=https://www.xfce.org/ >Main Page</a>)<li>LXQT(<a href=https://lxqt-project.org/ >Main Page</a>)<li>Budgie(<a href=https://github.com/BuddiesOfBudgie/budgie-desktop>GitHub</a>)<li>Mate(<a href=https://mate-desktop.org/ >Main Page</a>)</ul></ul></ul></li><br><li><div class=window-list-element>Status Bars</div>Status Bars are applications used to represent certain information regarding your system.
